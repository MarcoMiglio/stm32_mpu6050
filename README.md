# **STM32 library for mpu6050 (GY521) with motion/zero motion detection for low power implementations**

The following code is intended for STM32 boards. (Tested using STM32L476-RG NUCELO Board)
The library is adapted from Jeff Rowberg's existing library for the MPU6050 and Arduino boards. See his [GitHub page](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/mpu6050/blob/master/src/MPU6050.cpp)
