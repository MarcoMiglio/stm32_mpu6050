# **MPU6050 (GY-521) Driver for STM32 with Motion and Zero-Motion Detection**

An optimized STM32 library for interfacing with the MPU6050 (GY-521), featuring motion and zero-motion detection capabilities.  

The following code is intended for STM32 boards. (Tested using STM32L476-RG NUCELO Board)  
The library is adapted from Jeff Rowberg's existing library for the MPU6050 and Arduino boards. See his [GitHub page](https://github.com/ElectronicCats/mpu6050/blob/master/src/MPU6050.cpp)
